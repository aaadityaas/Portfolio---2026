/* =============================================================================
   Case Study Editor — Notion/Framer-style in-place editor for project-1.html
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - View mode: page renders exactly like a published case study.
   - Edit mode: every text node is contenteditable, every media slot accepts
     drag-and-drop, every block has a hover toolbar (drag handle, change
     layout/style, delete), and there's a "+" inserter between blocks and
     between sections to add new content.
   - Storage: localStorage draft (auto-saved on every change).
   - Local sync: when `npm run case-study:sync` is running on localhost, edits
     auto-write to content/*.json and asset/case-studies/* in the repo.
   - Publish: downloads a JSON snapshot backup; Sync to repo writes files directly.
   - Import: load a JSON file to replace the current draft.

   The data model intentionally matches what the previous sync script used so
   any existing default content keeps rendering. Adding new block types is a
   matter of (a) adding a renderer, (b) declaring it in BLOCK_REGISTRY, and
   (c) optionally adding inline controls in the block toolbar.
